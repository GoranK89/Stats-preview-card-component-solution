## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Got more experience with @media and flexbox, it was a nice practice. Still a lot of room to improve, my CSS solutions still feel like they are glued and taped together.

### Continued development

Currently taking an Udemy course on web development foundations, it definitely improved my skills a bit, but still have to cover the floats, flexbox and grids fundementals. Gaps in all of these topics still clearly shows in this project.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - For refreshing html tags nad css selectors, excellent with descriptions also.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) - Excellent web development course, builds really solid foundations!
